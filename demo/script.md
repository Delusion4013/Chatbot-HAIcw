## IR system

Let’s look at the information retrieval system. This system is used to respond to user’s query with the help of a built in QA database.

First, let’s try to type in a simple question. When Barack Obama was born? After a while, the bot would prompt the relevant information. 

Secondly, let’s try to format our query differently, this time we do not use question format but use a simple command. Tell me about singer Bob Seger. You could see the relevant information popped up with different formatting compared with the former one.

In the end, let’s try something that the database have not included. Tell me about Eason Chen. This is my favoriate Chinese singer. To my great disappointment, nothing relevant was found in the database.

Then we type close and end this sub-system.

## Game System

Now let’s look at the game system. This system contains three different text-based game.

Let’s try quiz game first. Type in little quiz for selection. Oh, the bot is asking for my name. Chenkai is my name. Ok. It’s now selecting quiz problems for me, hope it brings some difficult problems.

True for the first one. False for the second... wait, this is correct. False for the third one. Same for the fourth one and true for the fifth one. Got all right. Cool.

Let’s try the word guessing game then. Prompt my name again. Ok, so the word is of 6 letters. Let’s try A first. It hits! Let’s try E then. emmm it’s wrong. Type it again.. Oh, that’s a mistake, already guessed this letter. Let’s be naughty and input some characters, say question mark. well, it is not allowed. Oh I see,it might be galaxy. Yes!



## IM system

Let’s try Identity management system by asking who am i. Okay, does not know me, reasonable, call me Chenkai. Ok. Let’s check again. It works. It remembered me.
