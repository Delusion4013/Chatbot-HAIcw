## 1. Introduction

    - Introduce the system
    - Explain why choose to build them

In this coursework, I have implement the chatbot with features:
    1. Intent classification
    2. Entity recognition
    3. Small talk system
    4. Transactional System for booking...
    5. Information retrieval.

I wanted to build a general purpose chatbot which is extendable.

 



## 2. Background

- The book [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Chatbot-Development-with-Alexa-Skills-and-Amazon-Lex) gives me some background knowledge about the basic components of chatbots and how to implement them in python.
- The repo [here](https://github.com/parulnith/Building-a-Simple-Chatbot-in-Python-using-NLTK) gives me some ideas about how to perform basic greeting functions and let me finished my first version of chatbot.
- The blog [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-building-a-chatbot-with-spacy-and-deep-learning-d18811465876) gives me inspiration about how to do the intent classification and how to structure the chatbot with different intents.
